TODO LIST:

How to add up all members' values given a cage (for cagesSatisfiable)
    (use sum[...] ? - Have a "set" of members in Cage sig?)
    OR, 
    Is there a way if we add a cage field to the member class,
    to add up all members associated with a cage?

Is our operation architecture good or is it convoluted?

Check constraints for other types of cage-operations

EDPOST: How to set global fields, BOARD_ROW_NUM global variable, etc...
    MAX_BOUNDS, etc...
