What are you trying to model? Include a brief description that would give someone unfamiliar 
with the topic a basic understanding of your goal.

We're trying to model a 3x3 KenKen puzzle creator, a grid-based numerical puzzle using basic math operations
â€”addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Some KenKen instructions here:

A KenKen example: http://www.kenkenpuzzle.com/howto/solve! 

KenKen constraints/existing solver: https://wpm.github.io/CanCan/



Give an overview of your model design choices, what checks or run statements you wrote, and 
what we should expect to see from an instance produced by Sterling. How should we look at and 
interpret an instance created by your spec?

At a high level, what do each of your sigs and preds represent in the context of the model? 
Justify the purpose for their existence and how they fit together.

- predicates for Solvable (whole game as well as each individual Cage)
